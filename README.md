# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This website is an application that upon user request of an input entry, the application makes to different api requests that bring back current weather and forecast for next 5 days. Web Application also stores data (recent search history) this is later able to be clicked and retrieves data again.

- My motivation to build this application was to expand my knowledge in JavaScript, also to have a deeper understanding on how web api's work. It was a great motivation to also have a great portfolio project, and future potential employers will be able to get weather for their own good.
